## Whatâ€™s New in 3.2.3

**Audio Equalization available on Navigators**

The [Amplifier][1] and [AV Switch][2] Proxies have been enhanced to support the ability to display audio EQ functions on devices running Navigator. The enhancement includes a set of new Proxy Commands, Notifications and Capabilities to support this functionality.



**Dynamic Transport Controls on Navigators**

Audio Video drivers now have the ability to define which [transport controls][3] are displayed on Navigators. This includes which buttons appear on the Button Bar as well as the Media Dashboard. This enhancement allows for the appropriate transport controls being displayed for each AV device.
